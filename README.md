# Overview
The app functions similarly to the tipping calculator than can be found on Google: https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=tipping+calculator

You input the amount of the bill, the tip percent, and the number of people the bill should be divided by. 

The app is translated into Spanish. The app is not configured to work with tablets.
